# Predictive-Modeling-for-Car-Insurance-Risk-Assessment-and-Policy-Pricing-Optimization
This project uses predictive analytics to improve car insurance risk assessment and pricing. It builds models from a car insurance dataset to identify key factors influencing accident likelihood, such as driving history and credit scores. Insights guide policy pricing, risk reduction, and safer driving.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate predictive models to assess car insurance risk more accurately. By analyzing factors such as driving history, credit scores, and vehicle details, we aim to enhance policy pricing strategies and reduce the risk associated with insurance policies.
